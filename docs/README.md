This project is showcased to my teachers, peers, mentors, career coaches, recruiters, and hiring managers.

I want to create a web application that will allow you to store and maintain your own recipes as well as share them with family and friends.

I am creating this website, an online recipe box, in order to provide a way to easily store and share recipes.

The website will contain a homepage, a personal recipe page, and a page that contains the recipes others have shared with you.
